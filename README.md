# A little about this project
Hello, this repository serves as a container for all things NixOS as it relates to my files and configurations. With the help of two very good friends of mine, they have helped me in setting up this repository, and who were the catalysts for this project. As some prerequiste knowledge, NixOS is a linux distribution created by Eelco Dolstra that has an immutable design, and uses a model of updating where any errors that may occur will cause a revert to a previous stable instance, known as atomicity. NixOS is also declarative, meaning the configuration of one's setup can be reproduced across machines with relative ease due to packages being declared within the system environment. As I am a mathematics student, I'm not particularly well equipped when it comes to programming, though I enjoy learning concepts and attempting projects due to school (classes for my minor in CS) and as a hobbyist. This readme will likely be updated as I learn more about NixOS and Linux in general.
